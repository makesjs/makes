# makes ![CI](https://github.com/makesjs/makes/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

A tool to scaffold new projects, simple enough that you would want to define your own skeletons (aka generators).

# Limitation on Windows

"makes" on Windows requires native "tar" command in Windows 10 (or later). It cannot run on some early version of Windows 10 or any older Windows.

## Run "makes"

"makes" is designed to be used without any installation, as long as you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). To run "makes", do:

```bash
npx makes <skeleton_provider>
```

## Example skeletons

- [`aurelia/new`](https://github.com/aurelia/new) `npx makes aurelia`
- [`dumberjs/new`](https://github.com/dumberjs/new) `npx makes dumberjs`
- [`makesjs/demo1`](https://github.com/makesjs/demo1) `npx makes makesjs/demo1`
- [`makesjs/demo2`](https://github.com/makesjs/demo2) `npx makes makesjs/demo2`

Try `dumberjs` skeleton to create various types of front-end projects. [`dumberjs`](https://github.com/dumberjs/dumber) is a JavaScript bundler using AMD module format for front-end SPA apps.

```bash
npx makes dumberjs
# or
npx makes dumberjs my-project
```

Note `npx makes dumberjs` is a conventional short-cut of `npx makes dumberjs/new`.
